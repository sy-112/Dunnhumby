# Dunnhumby Data Analysis (still working on)

Over ⅓ of food sold in the UK is on promotion: promotional sales in groceries are worth over £28bn, 58% of people also claim to buy more promotions since the start of 20122. To consider whether this also occurs at such scale in the US food industry transaction data from Dunnhumby is manipulated to provide insights into the impact of promotions on units sold and store visits. Prices are highly fluctuating in the food industry, often on a daily or weekly basis; this led to comparing the price elasticities of individual products to determine the impact on consumer demands. Then different models are used to predict the overall demand.


There are two parts to this project. The first part is about exploring the data and finding the price elasticity.
The second part is about building different models to forecast the demand.
